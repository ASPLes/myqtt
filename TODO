--== roadmap ==--

* Add wildcard support (for message retention too).

* Big message support 

* High load support 

* Remove references to ppath concept inside myqttd

--== things that should be reviewed ==--

* Limit subscription size somehow. It could be a memory problem.

* Make client library to try to connect with 3.1.1 and if it fails, with 
  3.1.

* Disable wildcard subscription for certain users.

* After publishing first or second release, make the way to have myqtt
  listed under: http://mqtt.org/wiki/doku.php/server_support

* Limit utf-8 strings to avoid memory consumption. It makes no sense
  to have a username or password with 64K long (or the client
  identifier).

* Add support for will message storage (through external handler).

* Ensure support for:
  http://jpmens.net/2013/02/25/lots-of-messages-mqtt-pub-sub-and-the-mosquitto-broker/

* Ensure support for:
  http://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2013/03/24/d3-mqtt-tree-visualiser-updated/
  http://test.mosquitto.org/sys/

* Review and provide support for message ordering differences:
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mqtt/UfcO0HtLq9s/cjboTzdoR64J

* Some way of dynamically configuring/starting/stopping bridges, either
  via messages or via files (a directory watched by the daemon).

* More hooks to implement via plugin system, hook on store messages,
  hook on send message, hook on receive message.

* External storage like some kind of "casssandra connector"

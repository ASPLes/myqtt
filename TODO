--== roadmap ==--

* Add wildcard support (for message retention too).

* Big message support 

* High load support 

* Remove references to ppath concept inside myqttd

--== things that should be reviewed ==--

* Limit subscription size somehow. It could be a memory problem.

* Make client library to try to connect with 3.1.1 and if it fails, with 
  3.1.

* Disable wildcard subscription for certain users.

* After publishing first or second release, make the way to have myqtt
  listed under: http://mqtt.org/wiki/doku.php/server_support

* Limit utf-8 strings to avoid memory consumption. It makes no sense
  to have a username or password with 64K long (or the client
  identifier).

* Add support for will message storage (through external handler).

* Ensure support for:

* Ensure support for:

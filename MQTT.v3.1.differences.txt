Differences between MQTT v3.1 and v3.1.1

1) Protocol name has changed
2) Protocol level has changed
3) Client IDs MAY contain more than 23 encoded bytes.
4) Client IDs MAY be empty
5) Client ID is now restricted to only alphanumeric characters 

6) Check Appendix B for a full list of conformance statements.

7) There is also the "session present" flag in a CONNACK, the concept of
a failed subscription in a SUBACK, the requirement to validate that
topics are correct UTF-8 and others I'm sure. All unused flags must be
set as well.

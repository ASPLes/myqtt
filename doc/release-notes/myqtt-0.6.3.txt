                 --== MyQtt MQTT stack ==--
                         Freebird
                          0.6.3

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the first
public stable release of the MyQtt MQTT statck.

MyQtt is an Open Source professional MQTT stack written in ANSI C,
which supports v3.1.1 and v3.1, focused on providing support to create
MQTT servers/brokers. MyQtt has a modular design that allows creating
MQTT brokers/servers by using the API provided by libMyQtt (which in
fact is composed by several libraries: libmyqtt, libmyqtt-tls,
libmyqtt-websocket). 

It is also provided a ready to use MQTT broker called MyQttD which is
built on top of libMyQtt. MyQttD server is extensible by adding C
plugins.

Commercially supported, it is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1 (so
you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently is
being used by Core-Admin to provide a gateway to its API and by
http://asplhosting.com as a M2M protocol to coordinate customer data and
service activation across machines.
